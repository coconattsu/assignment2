    <h2{font-size:14px; height:50px;}>Assignment 2 - 4/26/2021</h2>
    <p>My index.html for this assignment can be found <a href="index.html">here</a>, and the style.css file can be found <a href="style.css">here</a>. </p>
    <li>Challenges<p>&emsp;I completed this assignment through much trial and error, experiementing with different color
                    combinations, dimensions on the page, flex settings, etc. It was really just about trying different combinations
                    of code to get the webpage to work. Getting the buttons to align the right way was especially difficult, so was
                    getting the "add new twit" button on the bottom right.
                    </p></li>
    <li>What I learned<p>&emsp;For this assignment, I learned how to make buttons, some basics of webpage layout design, how to use flex commands,
                                and how to implement basic css in my html files via classes. 
                        </p></li>
    <li>Resources Used<p>&emsp;For this assignment, I talked to my classmates on campuswire and discord, to get help with certain parts of the assignment.
                                I also used several of the provided css readings on the class website. 
    </p></li>
    <li>Google<p>&emsp;I had to google how to get the buttons to align in a max of 3 columns when the webpage was extended. I wasnt sure how to do this at first,
                        but it was covered in class after I implemented it into my website. 
</p></li>
